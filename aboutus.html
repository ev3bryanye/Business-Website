        Hi! we are Autosprout. 
      </p>
        <!--add image of bryan and dion here-->

       <p1>
        In 2020, we noticed an uptick in plant ownership during the pandemic, since then, 
        <br>
        the interest in gardening/growing plants has been consistently growing. 
        <br>Within the abundance of new plantownership, we noticed that there were many complaints of plants
        being dehydrated or dying when their owner's were away from home. In this situation, we saw an opportunity! 
        <br>
        Since we have extensive experience in the field of engineering 
        along with a passion for botany, we thought this would be the perfect time to develop a new product on the side. 
        <br>
        After four years of development, we finally released our product to the public in 2024. 
        Since then, we sold hundreds of thousands of autosprouts in the past year and hope to continue to serve the plant-growing community.

        <p20>
          In the past two years, we have noticed the impact of climate change on third world countries where millions of people are struggling every day to find drinking water. 
          This hits close to home since Bryan's great uncle grew up in Africa and would often go days without clean water. We promise to bring water to struggling peoples in Africa 
          since even plants have access to clean water, we feel we need to make sure every human on Earth has it too.
